 I have calculated the table by following mathematical rules of color
 integration and conversion from the CIE 1931 color space to sRGB.
 .
 I doubt that a numerically computed color table is copyrightable at all
 (in contrast to the actual software implementation). However, if it is
 indeed copyrightable, I have no problem with releasing it into the
 public domain.
